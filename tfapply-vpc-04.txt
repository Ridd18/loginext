Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Warning: Resource targeting is in effect

You are creating a plan with the -target option, which means that the result of this plan may not represent all of the changes requested by
the current configuration.

The -target option is not for routine use, and is provided only for exceptional situations such as recovering from errors or mistakes, or when
Terraform specifically suggests to use it as part of an error message.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

Warning: Applied changes may be incomplete

The plan was created with the -target option in effect, so some changes requested in the configuration may have been ignored and the output
values may not be fully updated. Run the following command to verify that no other changes are pending:
    terraform plan
	
Note that the -target option is not suitable for routine use, and is provided only for exceptional situations such as recovering from errors
or mistakes, or when Terraform specifically suggests to use it as part of an error message.

Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
